# Event discovery + planning
An app + web app that allows for event planning and event searching.

# Personal music/location curation
## Music
- Main limitation: Ideally, you would want to be able to auto play from youtube & spotify, but **research is required.**

## Location
I have Yelp, Google Maps, Kakao Maps, Naver Maps data, and I often cannot see them all in the same place. The idea is to be able to keep an app-agnostic site/app that has all my places saved.
